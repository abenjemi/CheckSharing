# LetShare

This app is a simplified version of Tricount (app for organizing expenses with friends). Basically, you enter the shared amount to pay with your friends (check in a restaurant for example), the number of people that share the amount, and a tip percentage. The app makes calculations and returns the price each person should pay.
